	This project is a text based combat simulator in which you will attack monsters in a room.  The room will spawn one of five random mosters with one of five different types of weapons. After you defeat the monster, you can pick up its weapon in order to defeat the next monster more easily. The game ends when you have defeated a total of five monsters.  This project uses the following Unix design philosophy rules: Rule of Transparency, Rule of Composition, and Rule of Extensibility. The Rule of Transparency was used when creating the different classes and files of this project. Each file is named according to its contents. The Rule of Composition was used by having each file stand as its own module that was designed to work well with other modules. The Rule of Extensibility was used when we created our classes and methods such that future modifications to the monsters, weapons, or environment will be easy to implement.
